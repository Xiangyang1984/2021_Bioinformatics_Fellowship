**PROJECT 2 RESOURCES**

This github page serves as a resource for students during project 2 of the UAlbany Summer Bioninformatis Fellowship. Students can find information on the datasets available to them as well as tools for analysis and visualization here.

Our intention is to make this github site available indefinitely as a resource for ongoing and future projects.

**DATASETS**

There are 8 datasets with pre-downloaded and assembled genomes to choose from. A short description of each dataset and a link to the associated publication can be found below. A folder containing the genomes for each dataset can be accesed on the server at the following location (network/rit/path/to/genome/folders)

1. _Lactobacillales_ isolates from the International Space Station.
This dataset consists of 19 _Lactobacillales_ isolates. Members of this genus (_Enterococcus_) have the potential to be pathogenic and carry antibotic resistance genes. You can read more about the genomes collected on the space station here: [Bharadwaj_et_al.pdf](https://github.com/spencer411/2021_Bioinformatics_Fellowship/files/6591772/Bharadwaj_et_al.pdf)

2. _Salmonella enterica_ Serovar Enteritidis isolates associated with outbreaks in Brazil.
This dataset consists of 30 _S. Enteritidis_ isolates originating from both patients and food sources during outbreaks that occured between 1999 and 2006. You can read more about the genomes here: [Cao_et_al.pdf](https://github.com/spencer411/2021_Bioinformatics_Fellowship/files/6592061/Cao_et_al.pdf)

3. Species and subspecies of the genus _Staphylococcus_.
This dataset consists of 64 type strains representing 50 species in the genus _Staphylococcus_ from the National Collection of Type Cultures, United
Kingdom (NCTC), Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Germany (DSMZ), and Culture Collection, University of GÃ¶teborg, Sweden (CCUG). You can read more about the genomes here: [Cole_et_al.pdf](https://github.com/spencer411/2021_Bioinformatics_Fellowship/files/6592256/Cole_et_al.pdf)

4. _Bacillaceae_ strains isolated from the International Space Station.
This dataset consists of 29 bacterial isolates from the family _Bacillaceae_. Members of this group are common, and can be found in soil, sediments, air, freshwater, marine ecosystems, foods and in extreme environments. You can read more about the genomes collected on the space station here: [Daudu_et_al.pdf](https://github.com/spencer411/2021_Bioinformatics_Fellowship/files/6592307/Daudu_et_al.pdf)

5. Swine-associated Methicillin-Resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_. 
This dataset consists of genome sequences for 63 Livestock-associated MRSA isolates all of Sequence Type (ST) 5, isolated in the United States. ST5 isolates are a public concern due to their pathogenicity and ability to acquire mobile genetic elements. You can read more about the genomes here: [Hau_et_al_1.pdf](https://github.com/spencer411/2021_Bioinformatics_Fellowship/files/6592628/Hau_et_al_1.pdf)

6. Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ ST5 isolates from a U.S. Hospital.
This dataset consists of 50 clinical MRSA isolates from humans with MRSA-related disease. You can reads more about the genomes here: [Hau_et_al_2.pdf](https://github.com/spencer411/2021_Bioinformatics_Fellowship/files/6592663/Hau_et_al_2.pdf)

7. _Streptococcus mitis_ strains isolated from a woman and her male sexual partner.
This dataset includes 39 genomes isolated from the oral cavity and urogenital tract of a woman and her partner. _Streptococcus mitis_ is common in humans and is considered to be a commensal species, but may also cause a variety of invasive diseases in human. You can read more about the genomes here: [Mores_et_al.pdf](https://github.com/spencer411/2021_Bioinformatics_Fellowship/files/6592768/Mores_et_al.pdf)

8. Genome sequences of biosafety level 2 pathogens from the International Space Station.
This dataset is comprised of 20 biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) opportunistic pathogens isolated from the environmental surfaces of the space station. BSL-2 pathogens pose a moderate health hazard. Examples of agents typically worked with in a BSL-2 environment include equine encephalitis viruses and HIV, as well as _Staphylococcus aureus_. You can read more about the genomes collected on the space station here: [Sielaff_et_al.pdf](https://github.com/spencer411/2021_Bioinformatics_Fellowship/files/6592801/Sielaff_et_al.pdf)
