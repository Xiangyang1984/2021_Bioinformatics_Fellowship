**PROJECT 2 RESOURCES**

This github page serves as a resource for students during project 2 of the UAlbany Summer Bioninformatis Fellowship. Students can find information on the datasets available to them as well as tools for analysis and visualization here.

Our intention is to make this github site available indefinitely as a resource for ongoing and future projects.

**DATASETS**

There are 8 datasets with pre-downloaded and assembled genomes to choose from. A short description of each dataset and a link to the associated publication can be found below. A folder containing the genomes for each dataset can be accesed on the server at the following location (network/rit/path/to/genome/folders)

1. _Lactobacillales_ isolates from the International Space Station.
This dataset consists of 19 _Lactobacillales_ isolates. Members of this genus (_Enterococcus_) have the potential to be pathogenic and carry antibotic resistance genes. You can read more about the genomes collected on the space station here: [Bharadwaj_et_al.pdf](https://github.com/spencer411/2021_Bioinformatics_Fellowship/files/6591772/Bharadwaj_et_al.pdf)

2. _Salmonella enterica_ Serovar Enteritidis isolates associated with outbreaks in Brazil.
This dataset consists of 30 _S. Enteritidis_ isolates originating from both patients and food sources during outbreaks that occured between 1999 and 2006. You can read more about the genomes here: [Cao_et_al.pdf](https://github.com/spencer411/2021_Bioinformatics_Fellowship/files/6592061/Cao_et_al.pdf)

3. Species and subspecies of the genus _Staphylococcus_.
This dataset consists of 64 type strains representing 50 species in the genus _Staphylococcus_ from the National Collection of Type Cultures, United
Kingdom (NCTC), Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Germany(DSMZ), and Culture Collection, University of GÃ¶teborg, Sweden (CCUG). You can read more about the genomes here: [Cole_et_al.pdf](https://github.com/spencer411/2021_Bioinformatics_Fellowship/files/6592256/Cole_et_al.pdf)

4. _Bacillaceae_ strains isolated from the International Space Station.
This dataset consists of 29 bacterial isolates from the family _Bacillaceae_. Members of this group are common, and can be found in soil, sediments, air, freshwater, marine ecosystems, foods and in extreme environments with high temperatures. You can read more about the genomes collected on the space station here: [Daudu_et_al.pdf](https://github.com/spencer411/2021_Bioinformatics_Fellowship/files/6592307/Daudu_et_al.pdf)
