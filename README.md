**PROJECT 2 RESOURCES**

This github page serves as a resource for students during project 2 of the UAlbany Summer Bioninformatis Fellowship. Students can find information on the datasets available to them as well as tools for analysis and visualization here.

Our intention is to make this github site available indefinitely as a resource for ongoing and future projects.

**DATASETS**

There are 8 datasets with pre-downloaded and assembled genomes to choose from. A short description of each dataset and a link to the associated publication can be found below. A folder containing the genomes for each dataset can be accesed on the server at the following location (path/to/genome/folders)

1. _Lactobacillales_ isolates from the International space station.
This dataset consists of 19 _Lactobacillales_ isolates. Members of this genus (_Enterococcus_) have the potential to be pathogenic and carry antibotic resistance genes. You can read more about the genomes collected on the space station here: [Bharadwaj_et_al.pdf](https://github.com/spencer411/2021_Bioinformatics_Fellowship/files/6591772/Bharadwaj_et_al.pdf)

For further information related to these isolates including Biosample accessions (that include metadata) feel free to access the following links below:
